					House Greyjoy of Pyke is one of the Great Houses of Westeros. It rules over the Iron Islands, a harsh and bleak collection
					of islands off the west coast of Westeros, from the castle at Pyke. The head of the house is the Lord Reaper of Pyke.
					House Greyjoy's sigil is traditionally a golden kraken on a black field. Their house words are "We Do Not Sow," although the
					phrase "What Is Dead May Never Die" is also closely associated with House Greyjoy and their bannermen, as they are associated 
					with the faith of the Drowned God.
					House Greyjoy had been in open rebellion against the Iron Throne since the War of the Five Kings, during which it sought
					independence for the Iron Islands once more. However, following the death of King Balon Greyjoy and the election of his brother,
					Euron, as the new King of the Iron Islands, House Greyjoy was divided between Euron and his followers, and Balon's surviving
					children, Yara and Theon, and their followers. Yara's faction, which had aligned with House Targaryen, was defeated by Euron,
					who has aligned himself with House Lannister upon the beginning of Daenerys Targaryen's invasion of Westeros.
