					House Tyrell of Highgarden is an extinct Great House of Westeros. It ruled over the Reach, a vast, fertile, 
					and heavily-populated region of southwestern Westeros, from their castle-seat of Highgarden as Lords Paramount of the Reach 
					and Wardens of the South after taking control of the region from House Gardener during the Targaryen conquest.
					The House was formerly led by Lord Mace Tyrell. Mace's son Loras was a noted tournament knight and, secretly, the lover of Lord
					Renly Baratheon. Mace's daughter Margaery married Renly when he crowned himself king in the War of the Five Kings to cement an 
					alliance between Renly and her father. Following Renly's death, Margaery was then married to King Joffrey Baratheon before his 
					assassination at his wedding feast. She was then married to his younger brother, King Tommen Baratheon. Mace's mother, the
					indomitable Olenna Tyrell, assumed House Tyrell's lordship after Margaery, Loras, and Mace Tyrell were all killed by wildfire
					at the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor. Under Olenna, House Tyrell realigned itself with House Targaryen and declared
					for Daenerys Targaryen in opposition against Cersei Lannister, who had orchestrated the downfall of House Tyrell. With the death 
					of Olenna after the Sack of Highgarden, the House has officially become extinct.
					The Tyrell sigil is a golden rose on a pale green field. Their house words are "Growing Strong."
