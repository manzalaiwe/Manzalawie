				The White Walkers are an ancient race of formerly-human ice creatures who come from the Far North of Westeros. After remaining 
				hidden for thousands of years, they have returned and been sighted by several sworn brothers of the Night's Watch and countless
				wildlings.  However, most who live south of the Wall believe them to be nothing more than creatures of legend.
				The White Walkers are thousands of years old, coming from the time preceding the Age of Heroes. Born of powerful and
				untested magic, they were created to protect the Children of the Forest from the First Men, who had waged war on them ever since
				they had arrived from Essos. However, the White Walkers eventually broke free of the Children's control and became the most feared
				creatures in Westeros, posing a threat to anything living.
