					House Targaryen of Dragonstone is a Great House of Westeros and was the ruling royal House of the Seven Kingdoms for three
					centuries since it conquered and unified the realm, before it was deposed during Robert's Rebellion and House Baratheon 
					replaced it as the new royal House. The two surviving Targaryens fled into exile to the Free Cities of Essos across the Narrow
					Sea. Currently based on Dragonstone off of the eastern coast of Westeros, House Targaryen seeks to retake the Seven Kingdoms 
					from House Lannister, who formally replaced House Baratheon as the royal House following the destruction of the Great Sept of 
					Baelor.
					House Targaryen's sigil is a three-headed red dragon on a black background, and their house words are "Fire and Blood."
