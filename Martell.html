					House Martell of Sunspear is a legally extinct Great House of Westeros. It ruled the peninsula of Dorne in the far south of the
					continent from their castle Sunspear. Though loyal to the Iron Throne, the Martells were never conquered by the Targaryens and
					pursued a more isolated role in wider political events since Robert's Rebellion.
					House Martell's sigil is a red sun pierced by a golden spear, on an orange field, a combination of the original Martell sigil
					- a yellow spear - and the emblem of Princess Nymeria - a red sun - to symbolize the marriage of the warrior-queen to Mors 
					Martell. Their house words are "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken."
					With the assassinations of Prince Doran Martell and his only heir, Prince Trystane, by Ellaria Sand and the three eldest Sand
					Snakes, House Martell is legally extinct, although the Sand Snakes carry Martell blood through their father Oberyn Martell.
					The Sand Snakes also continue to use the Martell sigil to represent themselves and Dorne.
					Under the leadership of Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes, the forces of House Martell and Dorne have aligned to support the 
					cause of Daenerys Targaryen against House Lannister after they declared war against them.
					Whatsoever, after the deaths of the older Sand Snakes and Ellaria's imprisonment in King's Landing, House Martell's future 
					is uncertain as five Sand Snakes still live .
