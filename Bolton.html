					House Bolton of the Dreadfort is an extinct great house from the North. After the Red Wedding, they became the Great House of
					the North, having usurped their position from their former liege lords, House Stark. Their original lands were in the northeast
					of the Stark territories. Their stronghold was a castle called the Dreadfort and the head of the house was the Lord of the 
					Dreadfort.
					House Bolton was infamous for its centuries-old practice of flaying their enemies alive, to the point that they used a flayed
					man as their House sigil. The Boltons supposedly gave up this practice after bending the knee to House Stark,[2] and centuries
					later Lord Eddard Stark outlawed flaying in the North altogether, but the Boltons continued the practice.[3] This resulted in 
					them being despised and feared by many of the Northern houses, especially after their betrayal of House Stark and their torching
					of Winterfell.
					Shortly before the Battle of the Bastards, Lord Ramsay Bolton murdered his father, Lord Roose Bolton, taking his father's titles
					and ranks. In the aftermath of the battle, Ramsay was defeated by Jon Snow and subsequently executed by the Starks; with no 
					heir to follow him, House Bolton has become extinct.
					House Bolton's heraldry consisted of a red flayed man upside-down on an x-shaped white cross over a field of black. Their house
					words were "Our Blades Are Sharp," though a common saying of members of the house was "A naked man has few secrets; a flayed
					man, none."
