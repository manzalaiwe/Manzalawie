					House Stark of Winterfell is a Great House of Westeros, ruling over the vast region known as the North from their seat in
					Winterfell. It is one of the oldest lines of Westerosi nobility by far, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight
					thousand years. Before the Targaryen conquest, as well as during the War of the Five Kings and Daenerys Targaryen's invasion
					of Westeros, the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the Kings in the North.
					Their rule in the North seemingly ended after the events of the Red Wedding when House Frey and House Bolton betrayed
					House Stark after forming a secret alliance with House Lannister, during which Roose Bolton murdered King Robb Stark. Both
					the North and Winterfell were taken over by House Bolton. However, the Bolton's hold was jeopardized when Sansa Stark escaped
					their clutches after learning her brothers Bran and Rickon Stark were still alive and reunited with her half-brother Jon Snow
					at Castle Black. Sansa and Jon marched on the Boltons to save their younger brother Rickon, who was later murdered by Ramsay
					Bolton, and retake their family home Winterfell. House Stark was restored to their former stature after the Battle of the
					Bastards. The Stark victory led to House Stark's return to royal status in the North with their bannermen declaring Ned Stark's
					illegitimate son Jon Snow as the King in the North. He later abdicated his title as king in order to gain the full support
					of Daenerys Targaryen in the Great War, becoming the Warden of the North.
					House Stark's sigil is a grey direwolf on a white background, over a green escutcheon. They are one of the few noble Houses
					whose family motto is not a boast or threat. Instead, the House Stark family motto is a warning, one that, no matter the
					circumstances, will always be relevant: "Winter Is Coming."
